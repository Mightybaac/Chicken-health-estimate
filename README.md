# Chicken Health Monitor

This is a Python program that helps monitor the health of a chicken based on various attributes such as weight, breed, appearance, and behavior.

## chicken.py

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where `chicken.py` is saved.
2. Run the command `python chicken.py`.
3. Follow the prompts to enter information about the chicken's attributes such as weight, breed, appearance, color, and behavior.
4. Enter the chicken's birthdate when prompted.
5. Enter a filename to save the health score.

The program will calculate a health score based on the information entered and the chicken's age, and save the score to the specified filename.

## life.py

This is a Python program that helps track the overall health of a chicken over time.

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where `life.py` is saved.
2. Run the command `python life.py`.
3. Follow the prompts to enter the health scores and ages of the chicken at various points in time. The scores and ages should be entered in chronological order, with the most recent score and age entered last.
4. When all scores and ages have been entered, the program will calculate the overall health of the chicken over time and display the result.

The program uses a weighted average of the health scores based on the ages at which the scores were obtained to calculate the overall health. The result is a number between 0 and 10, with higher scores indicating better health.
